## 🔍 Project Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
The dataset is loaded using Pandas to begin analysis.

### 2️⃣ Data Understanding
- Checked data types
- Checked number of rows and columns
- Reviewed summary statistics

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values
- Checked for duplicate records
- Dataset was clean and ready for analysis

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed price distribution
- Studied relationships between house features and price
- Visualized important patterns using graphs

### 5️⃣ Feature Selection
- Separated independent variables (X)
- Selected target variable (y → price)

### 6️⃣ Train-Test Split
- Data split into training and testing sets
- Ensures fair evaluation of the model

### 7️⃣ Model Building
- Built a Linear Regression model
- Trained the model on training data

### 8️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using metrics like R² score
- Checked how well the model predicts house prices
